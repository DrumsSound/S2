Guide:


Once you run the program you can choose between these different actions: 

   	1. Motion vector on BBB
        2. Container
       	3. MP4 track reader
        4. Subtitle
        exit. To end the program

 Now you can navigate throught the program.
 

 1. First option allows you to visualize the motion vector of the BBB video.
	The program will ask you if you prefer to see them overlayed to the original video or alone the mv.
	- Enter 0 if you want to overlap BBB video and mv.
	- Enter 1 if you want to generate a video with only mv.
 
 2. Second option allows you to create a mp4 container with:
	- 1 min long video fragment of BBB
	- 1 min long audio stereo mp3
	- 1 min long audio acc low bitrate
    
     The result will be an mp4 named: container.mp4
	* it will be required for further exercises (as a default video)    

 
 3. Third option allows you to read the different tracks of an mp4 video.
	- The program will allow you to enter the name of video you like to analize

	* If you press enter the file container.mp4 (from last chapter) will be used 
         
 4. Fourth option allows you add an srt file with subtitles to the 1m_BBB.mp4 file.
		

 exit. Finally if you want a close the program just type the word exit.

**Except for the first, (option 1, because they are too heavy) all the results are shared in the "outputs" folder
